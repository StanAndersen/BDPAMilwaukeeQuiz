# BDPAMilwaukeeQuiz
Application for Android

Originally done before version contol this is half way to version 2. Currently it is broken but upon completion it should be a better more effective application. The intention of this application is to help BDPA Milwukee High school students prepare for there competition. The content of the quizes is what is being tested. The current application needs to be redisgned to make the application more flexible. The backend needs to be converted to an API so it will work for a web application as well. For students that do not have access to an android phone.
Stage 2 of this application also includes sand boxing and automating installation using vagrant to allow for simpler development. Also it will include better design documentation and through unit testing to allow for simpler maintence. If you are interested please email me at SAwisconsin@gmail.com. I want the process of creating a better environment for appication testing.
Thanks, Stan Andersen.
